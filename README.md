Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total card value of 21. Each player is dealt two cards initially and can choose to 'hit' (receive another card) or 'stand' (keep their current hand). The dealer also receives cards, typically one face-up and one face-down. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.
